            It was 7:30 AM on a Tuesday when Linda Martinez realized she had become 'that woman.'

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            You know the one. The woman who grips the stair railing with both hands. The woman who winces getting out of chairs. The woman who makes excuses about why she can't join family walks.

            At 58, Linda had been dealing with knee pain for three years. What started as occasional stiffness had evolved into daily agony that dictated every decision she made.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That night, Linda couldn't sleep. Not from the pain – though her knees throbbed constantly – but from the crushing realization that this vibrant, active woman who raised four children and ran a business was becoming invisible.

            That's when Linda discovered the <strong>Kneexa Relief System</strong>.

            At first, she was skeptical. It looked nothing like the heavy-duty braces or pain patches she had tried before. But it turns out, that's the exact reason it worked…
