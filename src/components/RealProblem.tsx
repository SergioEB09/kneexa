          The Real Problem Doctors Don’t Want You to Know

            Linda’s story isn’t unique. If you’re reading this, you probably recognize
            yourself in her struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here’s what Linda discovered that changed everything: Her knee pain
            wasn’t from “just getting older.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite what her doctor told her (“It’s normal at your age”), Linda’s pain
            had a specific, fixable cause.
          </p>

    <p className="mb-2">
      <em>"Take these pills and learn to live with it,"</em> her orthopedist had said, scribbling out a prescription for pain medication.
    </p>
    <p className="font-semibold">Sound familiar?</p>

            Linda had heard the same dismissive response from three different doctors.
            Each one offered the same “solutions”:
          </p>

          <ul className="bg-white rounded-lg border border-[#E5E0DC] p-6 space-y-2">
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="text-red-500 mr-2">1.</span>
              <span>Stronger pain medications (with worse side effects)</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="text-red-500 mr-2">2.</span>
              <span>Expensive injections that wore off in weeks</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="text-red-500 mr-2">3.</span>
              <span>Joint replacement surgery as the “final option”</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start">
              <span className="text-red-500 mr-2">4.</span>
              <span>Physical therapy that was too painful to complete</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            But Linda began to realize something disturbing. These “solutions” weren’t
            actually solving anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pills masked her pain for a few hours, then it returned worse than
            before. The side effects—stomach problems, brain fog, potential
            addiction—were almost worse than the knee pain itself.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="italic text-sm md:text-base border-l-4 border-[#D66A5E] pl-4 text-[#444]">
            “I was spending $200 a month on medications that made me feel like a
            zombie,” Linda recalls. “And my knees still hurt.”
          </blockquote>

          <p className="pt-4">
            Linda calculated that her knee pain was costing her:
          </p>

          <ul className="bg-white rounded-lg border border-[#E5E0DC] p-6 space-y-2">
            <li>$2,400 per year in medications</li>
            <li>$180 per physical therapy session (with minimal results)</li>
            <li>Thousands in potential surgery costs</li>
            <li>But worst of all… her quality of life</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="pt-4">She was missing:</p>

          <ul className="bg-white rounded-lg border border-[#E5E0DC] p-6 space-y-2 text-red-700">
            <li>Precious moments with grandchildren</li>
            <li>Travel opportunities with her husband</li>
            <li>Simple pleasures like gardening and walking</li>
            <li>Her sense of independence and vitality</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="pt-4">
            The breaking point came when Emma asked, “Grandma, why don’t you play with
            me anymore?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Linda realized her knee pain wasn’t just affecting her body – it was
            stealing her identity as the fun, active grandmother she wanted to be.
          </p>

            <strong>I refused to accept that this was my new normal.</strong> Linda says.
            “There had to be a better way.”
